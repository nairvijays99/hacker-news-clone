People from the platform contacted me telling me one of the possible reasons was that I didn\u0026#x27;t have any code on GitHub. After that I started uploading all my code as open source projects and began to search places to tell people about it.\u003cp\u003eSoon I learned about Hackernews and made a post that got 1 vote. I then decided to contact HN to ask how can I get more traction to my projects and they told me about the Show HN, a tag design to share small and even unfinished projects. Soon I was posting every idea I ever had made into a project. After InvaderZ - a space invaders clone that uses genetic algorithm (\u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;news.ycombinator.com\u0026#x2F;item?id=21577659\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;news.ycombinator.com\u0026#x2F;item?id=21577659\u003c/a\u003e) - people started liking my projects and I started to gain some attention. That was very important cause I was being approached by some companies.\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#x27;t do projects to gather attention, I do cause I have fun doing them. I already had a lot of things done when I decided to upload them to GitHub. Well, in one of those times when my post was in top 10, a cool company from São Paulo saw me and called me for an interview. They liked my project so much they offer me a job.\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#x27;m living in São Paulo now, it\u0026#x27;s a huge city full of things to do and places to visit. It\u0026#x27;s been really cool so far and I have a huge appreciation for  Hackernews and the good people that work here. They provide a cool platform where people can share relevant news. They provide tools for people to start their own startup. They share job openings. They share companies that are hiring. It\u0026#x27;s a neat place for programmers, hackers and tech enthusiasts in general. I wrote this cause you never know when your story will inspire others and maybe there\u0026#x27;s someone on the struggle right now looking for a job. This was my experience. HN help me a lot and I think it might help you too. Thank you all and have a wonderful year.",

Click on a post\u0026#x27;s timestamp to go to its page, then click \u0026#x27;favorite\u0026#x27; at the top. Your favorites are linked from your profile, and you can browse other users\u0026#x27; from theirs.\u003cp\u003e4. On the front page and \u0026#x2F;newest, click \u0026#x27;hide\u0026#x27; if you no longer want to see a story. The next story in the list will slide up at the bottom.

You\u0026#x27;ll see all the front page stories for that day, sorted by how much time they spent there. For example, Alan Kay\u0026#x27;s AMA had the most front page time on June 20: https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;news.ycombinator.com\u0026#x2F;front?day=2016-06-20.\u003cp\u003eFinally, I\u0026#x27;m pleased to introduce sctb, a.k.a. Scott Bell, as a Hacker News moderator. Scott has been moderating HN incognito for a long time, but starting today he and I will be sharing the public part of the job. Since Scott is familiar with all aspects of HN moderation, you shouldn\u0026#x27;t notice any changes in practice; this is just an internal refactoring to enable such innovations as vacations and a day off. Scott is my cofounder from Skysheet (YC W09), an excellent programmer with a meticulous eye for detail, and a thoroughly decent human being. Please welcome him and be nice!",
